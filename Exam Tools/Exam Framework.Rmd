# 1. Initial project scope

Introduction part (Bullet Points)

-   The reason why I choose this question

-   The main dataset for the analysis is ... (describe the data source)

-   Introduce the data scale. (It is a very large dataset, with around 66,000 rows, where each row represents an eviction with columns holding information such as the date executed, ejectment (possession or eviction), and spatial unit data such as community district and census tract.)

-   A brief intro of the data wangling and analysis. This may include research questions or hypotheses.

-   Identify the limitations and constrains of the dataset. It could be the spatial or temporal limitations.

-   Require 10-15 bullet points. Check the Week 10 lecture notes.
